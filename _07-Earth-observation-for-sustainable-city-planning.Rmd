# Earth observation for sustainable city planning

## Abstract

Urban areas are expected to triple by 2030 in order to accommodate 60% of the global population. Anthropogenic landscape modifications expand coverage of impervious surfaces inducing the urban heat island effect; a critical 21st century challenge associated with increased economic expenditure, energy consumption and adverse health impacts. Yet omission of urban heat island measures from global climate models and metropolitan planning methodologies precludes effective sustainable development governance. We present an approach which integrates Earth observation and climate data with three-dimensional urban models to optimise vegetation placement (per m2) within proposed urban developments to enable more effective localised UHI mitigation. Such data-driven planning decisions will enhance the future sustainability of our cities to align with current global urban development agendas. 

## Introduction 

The United Nations (UN) New Urban Agenda aims to readdress the way in which cities are planned, designed, financed, developed, governed and managed to sustainably accommodate 60% of the global population by 2030. As one of the 21st century’s most transformative trends, urbanisation over this time frame will accommodate approximately 1.024 billion people alongside a tripling of the urban land cover footprint (Seto et al., 2012). Anthropogenic modifications whereby natural land covers are converted to urban surfaces is accepted as the most extreme form of land cover change, often initiating the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect where temperatures increase over human-made surfaces that can induce adverse socio-economic and environmental consequences (Hu et al., 2015). In the city of Melbourne, the economic implications of the UHI exceed AUD 300 million annually, and in Hong Kong the social repercussions of a 1°C rise in temperature above 29 °C increases mortality rates by 4.1% (Goggins et al., 2012). Environmentally, modelling for the city of Phoenix implies continued unsustainable water consumption where an increase of 0.56°C in daily minimum temperature escalates monthly water consumption by over 1,000 litres per family household (Guhathakurta and Gober, 2007), yet such models fail to account for the UHI effect which is exacerbating water and energy consumption in cities globally (Guhathakurta and Gober, 2007). Sustainable urban management is of vital contemporary importance to cities since the UHI is projected to increase the percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) lost by 0.71% (in 2050) and 1.04% (in 2100) for the low greenhouse gas (GHG) scenario and 0.80% (in 2050) and 1.79% (in 2100) under the very high GHG scenario (Estrada et al., 2017). Consequently, the UHI effect has been recognised in updated international polices, including the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and City Resilience Framework (CRF) (Supplementary Table 7-1). In response, global cities have implemented UHI reduction activities, categorised into voluntary or policy themes. The voluntary theme includes demonstrative projects, education and incentives such as Chicago’s exemplar ‘green’ city hall roof and Baltimore County’s ‘growing home’ campaign offering vouchers for purchasing trees. The policy theme incorporates the UHI into metropolitan spatial development strategies such as The London Plan, Perth and Peel @3.5 million and Johannesburg’s Spatial Development Framework 2040. However, these policies fail in planning practicality through lacking specificities for combating adverse temperature effects at the local level. Some UHI policy adaptations instigated by local governing authorities are permitting quantifiable planning requirements (e.g. zoning and building codes), such as Seattle’s ‘Green Factor’, Baton Rouge’s landscape ordinance and the City of Stirling’s Amendment 9 specifying minimum vegetation requirements for developments over a certain size (Supplementary Table 7-1). Yet most modern urban planning designs lack empirical evidence for optimal UHI mitigation strategies with the global state of data-informed governance described as underdeveloped, disparate and marginalised (McPherson, 2016; Michele Acuto, 2018).  

Earth Observation (EO) data permits the identification of (un)sustainable urban development in relation to environmental variables (e.g. temperature, elevation) at spatial and temporal scales unattainable from traditional point-based approaches (e.g. static weather station data) (MacLachlan et al., 2017c). Specifically, EO data can produce consistent information necessary for restricting unsustainable development (MacLachlan et al., 2017a) and monitoring UHI effects based on associated land-temperature dynamics (MacLachlan et al., 2017c). To date, EO applications have been frequently restricted to medium-scale spatial resolutions (e.g. 30 m) across complete metropolitan regions, which are inappropriate for determining temperature dynamics across new developments or explicit localised targeted remediation. Consequently, in this paper we build upon previous analyses (MacLachlan et al., 2017c, 2017a) to outline an operational methodology for evidence-based urban planning to optimise localised UHI mitigation through integration of EO data. Our analysis demonstrates the combined power of using remote sensing with open-source spatial modelling to derive temperature characteristics of different development types and determine optimal vegetation placement; we showcase this for a recently proposed redevelopment in the City of Fremantle, a council aiming to become Western Australia’s most sustainable local government within the state capital city of Perth.  

## Materials and methodology 

### Outline 

The presented spatially explicit modelling approach provides a method for data-informed targeted mitigative action at the pixel level (1 m2 spatial resolution) to overcome the shortcomings of inconsistent methodologies currently implemented by planning authorities for UHI mitigation, whereby coarse spatio-temporal resolutions and block aggregations can misinform area greening (Supplementary Table 7-1). This resolution was selected to capture localised elevation variations whilst providing an acceptable run time of around 1.5 days when modelling temperature every three hours over three years, coinciding with the data resolution used within both the original and most recent studies respectively proposing and implementing the model (Lindberg et al., 2018, 2008). Remotely sensed elevation data used in conjunction with high spatial resolution land cover data (e.g. aerial surveys), diurnal meteorological data and multitemporal resolution land cover data (e.g. Landsat) provided the necessary input data for modelling the temporal dynamics of mean radiant temperature (𝑇𝑇𝑚𝑚𝑢𝑢𝑜𝑜) and UHI intensity. 𝑇𝑇𝑚𝑚𝑢𝑢𝑜𝑜 defines the average temperatures surrounding a standing human, in this paper we refer to this output as ‘temperature’ to ease interpretation. We use an open-source temperature model to predict average temperature at a 1 m2 spatial resolution using three-hourly composite meteorological and shortwave radiation data for the period 2008-2010.  

Temperature Temperature dynamics of different density urban areas (Figure 7-1 (a)) were compared and optimum vegetative placement based on the average temperature for a proposed redevelopment within the City of Fremantle were determined (Figure 7-1 (b)). For the latter, three scenarios were processed: (1) the current urban footprint, (2) proposed changes to the urban footprint based on a proposed redevelopment, and (3) modelling the proposed redevelopment with no vegetation to redesign vegetation placement to optimise average temperature  for the redevelopment footprint under investigation. The proposed site and surrounding city blocks were modelled in all scenarios accounting for influence of neighbouring landscape features (e.g. shadowing).  

### Materials

#### High resolution aerial imagery 

High spatial resolution data were acquired to generate land cover estimates alongside a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to capture the topographical characteristics and dimensions of the urban landscape. Radiometrically calibrated multispectral red (0.58–0.77 µm), green (0.48–0.63 µm), blue (0.41–0.54 µm), and near-infrared (0.69–1.00 µm) orthophotos were obtained for March 2009 from the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Perth and Peel Urban Monitoring Programme (Caccetta et al., 2012), through the National Environmental Science Program’s Clean Air and Landscape Hub. The aerial imagery provided by CSIRO was captured between 10:00 and 14:00 to reduce the effect of shadowing using a Microsoft UltraCAM-D at an altitude of 1300 m producing a spatial resolution of 20 cm. 60% forward and 30% side frame overlap enabled automatic DSM computation using geometric control points provided by Western Australia’s land information authority (Landgate). CSIRO’s extraction of ground points facilitated derivation of a DEM, with subtraction from the DSM producing a Relative Elevation Model (REM). Due to no data values within the provided Subiaco REM, this was recomputed from the provided DSM and DEM. Vegetation identification by CSIRO was performed though derivation of multiple discriminant functions using canonical variate analysis with rational polynomials (CVAR). Specification of decision boundaries using a hierarchical approach yielded eight spectral classes with the REM determining trees (2 m and above) or grass (below 2 m) processed by CSIRO (Caccetta et al., 2011). Minor manual REM edits were undertaken through digitisation to capture senescent vegetation.     

#### Meteorological data 

Required meteorological data for temperature modelling included air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed, and wind direction, obtained from the Perth international airport weather station (YPPH); the most complete temporal record within the Perth Metropolitan Region (PMR). Data were captured by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) and freely distributed through the Weather Underground Application Interface (API). Whilst wind speed and direction are classed as ‘not needed’ by the model implemented here (detailed in the next section), lack of wind has been identified as a contributing factor to increased UHI intensity (Gaffin et al., 2008; Lindberg et al., 2017). In Perth during summer months major land and sea temperature differences induce an onshore wind of up to 40 km hour-1 termed the ‘Fremantle Doctor’ cooling the metropolitan region (Eliot et al., 2006). The continuous meteorological data were used to enable estimation of temperature for each time point (three-hourly) within the model. To achieve this, meteorological variables at hourly time steps in 2008, 2009 and 2010 were temporally matched to three-hourly downward shortwave radiation from the Water and Global Change (WATCH) Forcing Data methodology applied to ERA-interim (WFDEI) data (Uppala et al., 2005; Weedon et al., 2014). WFDEI data are based upon the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMEF) ERA-40 reanalysis data at 0.5° spatial resolution, but with inclusion of more extensive satellite, atmospheric and surface observations alongside slight differences in processing and formatting (Uppala et al., 2005; Weedon et al., 2014). WFDEI values were validated against seven flux tower measurement sites, replicating validation of the WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) (Weedon et al., 2011, 2010) with statistically significant correlations found between all variables at all sites, with the exception of precipitation at Manaus, demonstrating acceptable performance for estimating temperature (Weedon et al., 2014). 

#### Open Street Map data 

Open street map road data with minor manual digitisation editing to reflect past 2009 road layouts guided three-dimensional modelling of the low (Currambine) and high (Subiaco) density Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) defined Level 1 Statistical Areas (SA1) presented in Figure 7-2. Owing to the use of differing subsets compared to chapter 5 and the requirement of detailed digital shapes (e.g. polygons, points and lines) precluded use of previously classified medium resolution EO data (e.g. chapter 4). Therefore open street map data provided an easily integratable, open source and replicable solution in guiding three-dimensional models. 

#### Proposed planning application data 

Proposed redevelopment plans were used to modify input model parameters for the site and used in conjunction with modelled temperature information to optimise site vegetation placement. The City of Fremantle’s planning portal provided the publically distributed proposed redevelopment plans for the Woolstore Shopping Centre and Carpark located at 28 Cantonment Street, Fremantle. 

### Methodology 

#### Temperature modelling 

The methodology implements the recently developed UMEP model; an open-source holistic analytic tool for urban climatology and climate sensitive planning applications (Lindberg et al., 2018). UMEP can estimate anthropogenic heat fluxes, urban energy balances, and thermal comfort, over a range of temporal and spatial scales adaptable to multiple data sources and formats (Lindberg et al., 2018). The UMEP permits continuous temperature modelling across complex urban environments, an ideal tool for this analysis. Temperature was estimated at a 1 m2 spatial resolution and three-hourly intervals using the SOLWEIG (Solar and LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry) model. Current metropolitan development procedures often mandate minimum vegetation requirements (e.g. Seattle’s ‘Green Factor’), yet if inappropriately landscaped, such as exclusive separation of land covers, could result in sub-optimal heat mitigation (Supplementary Table 7-1). Similarly, UHI strategies frequently use temperature extracted from coarse satellite imagery aggregated to city blocks covering inappropriate temporal periods (e.g. monthly average) that can misguide remediation activities (e.g. Fremantle’s ‘Urban Forest’, Supplementary Table 7-1). Specifically, certain block subdivisions may exacerbate overall temperature yet public land availability can restrict planting to inappropriate sites within the block. Modelling urban temperature at high spatiotemporal resolution enables resource optimisation through refinement of potential sites at 1 m2 spatial resolution that will most influence overall temperature and determine preferable vegetation distribution within new developments, negating unsustainable designs. With increasing global availability of elevation (e.g. Open Topography), land cover (e.g. GlobeLand30 (Chen et al., 2015)) and meteorological data, our accessible methodological can be replicated within planning procedures to aid the sustainable development and restorative urban design of our cities for localised UHI reduction. 

The SOLWEIG model required the following user-determined inputs, modified for each modelled scenario where appropriate: continuous meteorological data, land cover information, building and ground DSM and a vegetation canopy REM (Figure 7-1 (a)). Land cover (excluding trees) was derived from manual digitisation of CSIRO high resolution imagery. CSIRO elevation models and the manually edited vegetation layer were combined to produce the building and ground DSM and vegetation canopy REM. Nearest neighbor resampling of input data to 1 m2 pixels avoided excessive processing times following the recommended resolution of the UMEP model (Lindberg et al., 2017). Temperature in urban environments is strongly influenced by urban geometry, including building height, aspect and the Sky View Factor (SVF), essential components to human comfort, solar access, and solar energy (Holst and Mayer, 2011; Lau et al., 2015). Within UMEP wall height and aspect were computed using the building and ground DSM, using an edge detection filter for the former (Lindberg et al., 2015b) and a linear filter for the latter (Goodwin et al., 2009; Lindberg et al., 2015a). The SVF, defined by the ratio of radiation received (or emitted) by a planar surface to the radiation emitted (or received) by the entire hemispheric environment, was determined using a shadow casting algorithm using the building and ground DSM and vegetation REM (Lindberg and Grimmond, 2010; Watson and Johnson, 1987). The SOLWEIG model estimates temperature through modelling shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes in six directions: upward, downward and four cardinal points (Lau et al., 2016; Lindberg et al., 2008). Temperature estimates from the SOLWEIG model have been extensively validated for global cities including Shanghai (Chen et al., 2016), Hong Kong (Lau et al., 2016) and Gothenburg (Lindberg and Grimmond, 2011), producing strong correlation between modelled and field measurements (R2>0.90), with the latter city validation noted as statistically significant. Annual SOLWEIG temperature estimates were averaged over the three modelled years to reduce inter-annual variation (Hu et al., 2015; Imhoff et al., 2010; MacLachlan et al., 2017c; Zhang et al., 2012).  

#### Optimising vegetation placement 

Fifteen trees, as specified in the original redevelopment plans, were manually distributed according to the highest average annual temperature values, being placed in the centre of a pixel whilst preserving design aspects including: crown radius (2.82 m), spacing (> 7 m) and height (vegetation on street level at 16.41 m and vegetation on buildings at 3.54 m). The new vegetation locations were reflected in an updated vegetation canopy REM achieved through digitisation and new mosaicked raster, re-running the analysis for comparative temperature across the redevelopment site to the original and proposed redevelopment (Figure 7-1).

## Analysis of Earth observation data  

The influence of localised urban development types on temperature dynamics was established through comparison of two census areas within the city of Perth. In addition, the potential for applied mitigative planning UHI action was demonstrated through modelling recently proposed plans for a site redevelopment. As Western Australia’s state capital, Perth has experienced rapid and sustained outward low density development since the end of the 20th century in response to a booming resource sector, increasing the urban area by 37.44% (279.80 km2) between 2000 and 2015 (MacLachlan et al., 2017a). The two ABS SA1s selected for the comparative analysis represent areas which have undergone (i) low density urban fringe green field development (Currambine) and, (ii) high density brownfield infill development (Subiaco). The former area was purely subject to the metropolitan region scheme implementing a master plan to outline provisions for development and use of land, but the latter was superseded by the Subiaco Redevelopment Scheme (SRS) which provided more critical localised development objectives prepared by experts with public consultation (Supplementary Table 7-1). Commencing with similar population density (per 0.1 km2) values in 2011 (Subiaco: 325, Currambine: 310), by 2015 Subiaco more than doubled in density compared to Currambine (Subiaco: 712, Currambine: 324) (Supplementary Table 7-2). Full details on the study site can be found in the supplementary material, section 7.7. 

Figure 7-2. Three-dimensional city models (top row) and average annual mean radiant temperature (𝑇𝑇𝑚𝑚𝑢𝑢𝑜𝑜) overlays (bottom row) for subsets of two SA1 locations representing low (cul-de-sac in Currambine) and high (infill site in Subiaco) density developments. Two-dimensional renditions for complete SA1 coverage are presented in Supplementary Figure 7-4. 

The urban design characteristics of the low density development, such as lower building heights, less dense vegetation and more sprawled layout, produced higher average temperatures of 1.00 °C (paved), 0.90 °C (grass) and 0.60 °C (buildings) compared to that of the high density infill site over the spatial extent of the three-dimensional view area (Figure 7-2). The complete SA1 of Currambine experienced higher temperatures of 0.54 °C (paved), 0.39 °C (grass) and 0.14 °C (buildings) compared to that of Subiaco (Supplementary Figure 7-4). The Western Australia Planning Commission (WAPC) recognise sustainability concerns within the PMR due to the majority of new development occurring as low density, outward suburban sprawl encroaching into the wildland-urban interface. To combat such apprehensions, the WAPC have detailed infill development strategies alongside UHI reduction aspirations for the long-term (2050) development of the city. Whilst local governments, such as the City of Bayswater and Stirling, have observed population increase with infill development, the tendency towards larger houses on subdivided blocks has significantly declined the level of tree canopy coverage. Consequently low density development and associated canopy reduction are adversely impacting the localised UHI effect (Supplementary Table 7-1). 

Reactively, planning initiatives by the City of Fremantle and City of Perth have initiated novel EO data-driven urban forest plans for directing tree planting, whereby medium temporal resolution data (16-day return period) have been used to produce static summer average land surface temperatures aggregated by city block. Such decentralised initiatives are advancing other local schemes, including Pennsylvania’s ‘Treevitalize’, and in Arizona and California where state urban forestry programs aim to increase tree coverage. Urban greening assists in cooling environments through shading and evapotranspiration, reducing the amount of solar radiation reaching the ground and providing ambient heat dissipation respectively (evidence drawn from assessments in Supplementary Table 7-1). Increased neighbourhood green [and blue (Gascon et al., 2017)] space has also been positively associated with better mental health outcomes, such as in Wisconsin (Beyer et al., 2014) and London (Taylor et al., 2016). In terms of relevant enforceable landscape ordinance in Perth, 10% of any gross subdivisible area is required for public open space, normally as a green recreation reserve; a policy which has remained unaltered since the first [StephensonHepburn] metropolitan regional plan was legislated in 1955. These stipulations for open space were based upon population density values, with an assumed number of persons likely to be housed across various residential codes (dwellings per hectare), which ensued to be a gross underestimation for required open space (Grose, 2007). Comparatively, Singapore’s 2011 open space provisioning is defined as 4.05 m2 for every 56.0 m2 of gross floor area with detailed landscaping requirements such as grass coverage, tree girth, and minimum branches, yet excludes landscape arrangement conditions (Supplementary Table 7-1). Despite such regulations for promoting city open spaces, global policies lack an effective data-driven approach in deriving optimal vegetative placement — particularly for reducing the ever-increasing socio-economic and environmental impacts associated with UHI effects — with current methods restricted by a lack of spatial data and analysis or coarse resolution, block aggregation, limited temporal data collection and outdated open space legislation.   

## Applied data-driven vegetation optimisation 

Recently published and updated international policies express the importance of UHI reduction due to current exclusion from global climate models, and as a result metropolitan spatial development strategies are having to evolve to reflect these model omissions. Yet modern city development and restorative urban schemes are hampered by a lack of consistent and scientifically valid decisions which can unnecessarily exacerbate the UHI effect (Supplementary Table 7-1). Building on our temperature modelling we illustrate a data-driven approach for optimally placing vegetation for effective planning to locally minimise the UHI. This is demonstrated through modelling the proposed redevelopment plans of the Woolstores shopping centre in the City of Fremantle, from retail to a mixed-use development containing accommodation, commercial property and hotel. The proposed redevelopment will alter land cover from high to low urban reflectance (albedo) which, based on our previous analyses (MacLachlan et al., 2017c, 2017a), represents the optimum urban land cover conversion. At the intra-development scale a data-driven approach can optimise vegetative placement providing evidence to mitigate excess temperatures. Through removing the vegetation of the proposed redevelopment (see Supplementary Figure 7-5) and modelling average temperature per year optimal locations to relocate vegetation were determined. The proposed redevelopment experienced a 1.2 °C reduction in average annual temperature across the site in comparison to the original retail complex. Whilst maintaining proposed building layout and vegetation design characteristics, such as height and spacing, data-driven vegetation placement abated a further 0.8 °C, with a maximum average temperature reduction of 0.9 °C (Figure 7-3). Simplistic and achievable reductions of this nature are especially important due to the range of health, energy, water and economic savings attributable to a 1 °C increase in temperature. For example, an associated 7.5% electricity demand rise in Bangkok (Santamouris et al., 2015) and a 2.1 % increase in respiratory admissions in six Mediterranean cities in relation to maximum apparent temperature (Michelozzi et al., 2009).

Also indicated are the average annual minimum, mean and maximum mean radiant temperature with colour-coded circles for each urban footprint scenario. The proposed redevelopment constitutes increased building height and variation across the site enlarging shading potential, reducing site mean radiant temperature compared to the original urban area. New vegetation locations and locator maps are exhibited in Supplementary Figure 7-5.  
 
## Global applicability

Urbanised areas are expected to triple by 2030 (2000 baseline of 652,825 km2) with the Cities and Biodiversity Outlook estimating that 60% of land projected to be urban by 2030 is yet to be built. Current voluntary and policy UHI mitigation policies that aim to increase vegetation coverage frequently fail in location optimisation owing to a lack of spatial data, broad aggregation and selective temporal sampling (Supplementary Table 7-1). Integration of UHI mitigation frameworks, such as the analysis presented here, into international and metropolitan spatial development strategies would overcome the current inconsistent and varied urban planning methodologies exhibited through frequent devolution to local governments, and the incomparability of their results. Upon receipt of development applications, our analysis could be replicated by planning agencies to ensure strategic vegetation placement in reducing overall temperature; a consideration that should be an essential pre-requisite in planning approval for enhancing localised UHI mitigation. Inclusion at the proposal stage would mitigate aforementioned implications and diminish the requirement for extensive urban forest plans and associated financial costs, e.g. estimated at AUD 2.57 million for the complete City of Fremantle strategy (Supplementary Table 7-1). Similarly, application to existing metropolitan regions could maximise often limited resource investment in optimising restorative urban areas, overcoming the limitations of current methods (e.g. block aggregation). Through scientifically rigorous datainformed governance, metropolitan cities and federations will be able to effectively interact with, and numerically quantify, mitigation actions for meeting international sustainable development policy requirements such as the reduction of environmental costs (e.g. excess temperature) of the UHI specified in the New Urban Agenda (McPherson, 2016). We advocate that the transformation of multi-level policy to incorporate data-driven frameworks, like that proposed here, is an essential requirement for ensuring the future socio-economic and environmental sustainability of our cities.

### Study area 

The Perth Metropolitan Region (PMR) has observed sustained low density outward urban expansion since the beginning of the 21st century in response to a rapidly expanding resource sector (Kennewell and Shaw, 2008; MacLachlan et al., 2017a, 2017d). The state’s value of mineral and petroleum resources increased from AUD 4.7 billion in 1996 to a peak of  AUD 121.6 billion mid-2013, contributing 95% of Western Australia’s export earnings between 2010 and 2011 (Department of Mines and Petroleum, 2015). Urban area within the PMR has increased 45.3% (320.33 km2) between 1990 and 2015, with a 37.44% increase since 2000 (279.80 km2) (MacLachlan et al., 2017a, 2017b). Perth was consistently considered Australia’s fastest growing city between 2007 and 2014, whilst only obtaining a maximum population density (2011) of 3,662 people per km2; 33.82% and 24.83% lower than Melbourne (10,827) and Sydney (14,747) respectively (ABS, 2015, 2011; MacLachlan et al., 2017a). Low population density has generated demand for dispersed housing in a non-strategic, ‘lot-by-lot fashion’ founded upon a cardependent lifestyle (Dhakal, 2014). Due to the large scale conversion from natural land to impervious surfaces, sustainability concerns are specified within the Western Australian Planning Commissions (WAPC) long-term (2050) development guide. Specifically, land rezoning must meet strategic planning objectives, as opposed to individual requests, with Urban Heat Island (UHI) mitigation listed as one of sixteen aspirations under the city sustainability objective. In response, local governments have devised policies and targets including the City of Fremantle’s and City of Perth’s Urban Forest Plans that outline greening strategies and deadlines (Supplementary Table 7-1). In determining locations for greening, temporally-specific low resolution imagery and associated satellite land surface temperature data have been used at coarse spatial resolutions (e.g. city blocks) by these planning councils (Supplementary Table 7-1). Such methodologies have potential to provide misinformed, inconsistent and sub-optimal mitigation through consideration of temperature at a singular time of day over a large spatial extent. Nevertheless, other local governments lack any specific UHI policy but recognise the value of maintaining vegetation, for example, Wanneroo’s ‘street tree’ policy and Subiaco’s ‘plant management’ plan (Supplementary Table 7-1). 

Supplementary Table 7-1. Relevant influential international, metropolitan and local UHI and urban expansion policies, strategies and assessments (with publication date) referred to in this paper. *Documents lack specific UHI related policy but recognise the value of maintaining vegetation. 

Here, the developed methodology was firstly used to compare two Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Level 1 Statistical Areas (SA1), the smallest enumeration unit for which population data is provided within the PMR, representing areas of low (within the suburb of Currambine) and high (within the suburb of Subiaco) density developments. In this paper we refer to these two SA1 areas using the names “Currambine” and “Subiaco” to ease interpretation. The SA1 geographical census enumeration identification numbers for these two areas are provided in Supplementary Figure 7-4. The Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority (MRDA), established in 2011, is responsible for land development within Subiaco, as outlined in version 1 (2013) and version 2 (2017) of the Subiaco Redevelopment Scheme (SRS), which has superseded the Metropolitan Region Scheme (MRS) planning documentation and associated spatial plans (Supplementary Table 7-1). Specifically, the MRDA seeks positive social, economic and environmental development outcomes by transforming underutilised and derelict industrial land through targeted projects. Comparatively, development in Currambine must adhere to the MRS and metropolitan development plan, neither of which directly consider sustainable development or the UHI effect (Supplementary Table 7-1). Secondly, the temperature dynamics of a recently proposed redevelopment for the Woolstores shopping centre in the City of Fremantle were modelled to determine optimal vegetation placement for localised UHI reduction, demonstrating the influence of an applied data-driven planning approach.

### Other considered data and approaches 

When selecting an appropriate tool to model temperature the DART model for remote sensing images and radiative budget of Earth’s surfaces was originally explored (Gastellu-Etchegorry et al., 2004). However, this chapter was designed to be applied and policy focused within the current capabilities of planning departments. Consequently owing to DART’s licensing requirements, standalone software nature and lack of a simple and straightforward graphic user interface it was not selected for use.  

In terms of further analytical approaches appropriate vegetation locations were originally determined through multiple criteria analysis equally considering temperature and the number of heatwave days per pixel. The latter was computed following the Australian Bureau of Meteorology excess heat factor index (Nairn and Fawcett, 2014). Whilst the number of heatwave days reduced in line with the temperature reductions observed in chapter 7, the number of days identified was particularly high (e.g. between 164 and 140). The excess heat factor establishes a heatwave day in comparison to long term weather station data at ground level. Consequently as a large part of the planning proposal within this chapter was higher than ground level the number of heatwave days was overestimated. Therefore as this analysis could potential cause misinformation pertaining to vegetation placement it was exclude.
