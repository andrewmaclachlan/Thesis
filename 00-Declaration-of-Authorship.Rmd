Andrew MacLachlan designed the methodological procedure, processed and analysed all data and produced manuscript drafts. The co-authors assisted in guiding research objectives and provided valuable advice and manuscript comments in a supervisory capacity. Dr Biggs critically commented on policy applications and data output, especially Figure 6 8 that was selected for the Journal Issue front cover. Dr Roberts provided practical methodological advice and assisted in selecting appropriate data for figures and tables presented throughout the paper.
