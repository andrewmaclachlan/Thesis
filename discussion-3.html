<p>This chapter provides a synthesised discussion of the individual research chapters, the transferability and global applicability of the thesis methodology, and a reflection on the critical challenges identified through this research.</p>
<div id="research-significance" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Research significance</h2>
<p>This thesis has provided a holistic practical and applied workflow in monitoring urban areas and presented a methodology which can demonstrably mitigate the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect through a data-driven approach to enable effective data-informed governance. Specifically the methodologies and outputs exhibited here permit scientifically valid and accurate quantitative comparison to global (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations (UN) Urban Agenda), metropolitan (e.g. The London Plan, Perth and Peel <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="3.5"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> million and Johannesburg’s Spatial Development Framework 2040) and local (e.g. Fremantle and Perth’s Urban Forest programmes) frameworks and targets.</p>
<p>Accurate information on the temporal evolution of urban areas is essential in order to monitor the effect of policy on development and identify potential socio-economic and physical consequences of development, such as air degradation, socio-economic disparities, infrastructural costs, water soil and quality deterioration, the UHI effect, changing water demand and runoff patterns, and reduced biodiversity (Batty et al., 2003; Li et al., 2015; Schneider, 2012; Sexton et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2005). Paper 1 (chapter 4) provided an operational remote sensing methodology for establishing change in urban area extent for seven sequential Landsat images between 1990 and 2015 for the Perth Metropolitan Region (PMR). This meets the first objective of the PhD research, achieved through consistent classification using the recently developed Import Vector Machine (IVM) classifier, overcoming the current temporal methodological inconsistencies implemented by the Western Australian Planning Commission (WAPC) in monitoring urban areas (e.g. Cadastral valuations, use of multiple urban zones (from 2009) and spatial modelling (from 2010)).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, classified Earth observation (EO) data such as that described in paper 1 (chapter 4) have been found to significantly over or underestimate urban area as a result of spatial constraints (Lu et al., 2011; Wu and Murray, 2003). Resolving errors of this type is a crucial current challenge in the application of EO data in such areas due to the potential for misinforming decision makers (e.g. on future development) whilst also forming the basis of further environmental studies. For example, Landsat derived urban area estimates have been used within global biogeochemistry and climate models (Zhu and Woodcock, 2014), targeted urban development policies (Hepinstall-Cymerman et al., 2013; Schneider et al., 2005) and UHI studies (Hu et al., 2015), and any over or under estimation of urban area has potential to misinform these applications. Consequently paper 2 (chapter 5) builds on the work presented in paper 1 (chapter 4) through firstly establishing the over estimation of urban area derived using a classified Landsat image (produced in paper 1 (chapter 4)) through comparison to very high resolution (20 cm) aerial imagery. On the basis of this, a correction methodology to calibrate sub-pixel Landsat derived urban area estimates against classified very high resolution data aggregated to Landsat spatial resolution was developed, aligning with the second PhD research objective.</p>
<p>Paper 3 (chapter 6) and paper 4 (chapter 7) undertook analysis in relation to global, metropolitan and local sustainability goals, specifically related to the UHI effect, coinciding with the third and fourth PhD research objectives. Paper 3 (chapter 6) devised a new methodological approach, building on existing research that disregards spatial and temporal land cover change when characterising the impact of urbanism on surface temperature. Previous research often assumes static urban area across multiple years or uses a singular global index such as the Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHII) which is less appropriate for applied planning decisions (Cao et al., 2010; Kikon et al., 2016; Tomlinson et al., 2012). The methodology developed in chapter 6 derived land cover change – temperature associations using Land Surface Temperature (LST) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) between 2003 and 2013 and the previously classified land cover data (derived in paper 1 (chapter 4)). Determination of land cover and temperature relationships of this type permit direct incorporation into future development decisions. For example, this approach could be applied when selecting areas for future rezoning of land for urban development in order to mitigate any unnecessary social, environmental and economic impacts associated with an increase in surface temperature.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the majority of UHI focused academic research, such as that discussed in paper 3 (chapter 6) has utilised medium (30 m) and coarse (1 km) spatial resolution LST data (Kikon et al., 2016; Tomlinson et al., 2012). Similarly, recent local government initiatives such as those in the City of Fremantle and Perth used Landsat LST from limited temporal observations (e.g. summer) and aggregated results to city block level in guiding urban greening (City of Fremantle, 2017; City of Perth, 2006). Data and analysis of this sort are inappropriate for localised planning decisions at sub-city block levels and can misguide remedial vegetation initiatives. For example, certain subblock sections may exacerbate overall block temperature, yet available land restricts sites for remedial actions resulting in sub-optimal mitigation and overall investment (City of Fremantle, 2017). Consequently, paper 4 (chapter 7) presented a data-driven approach in optimising vegetation placement for a proposed redevelopment within the city of Fremantle. The proposed redevelopment constituted a change in land cover from high to low urban albedo obtaining the least overall temperature change based on analysis in paper 3 (chapter 6). Optimal vegetation relocation whilst maintaining design principles reduced average annual mean radiation temperature (𝑇𝑇𝑚𝑚𝑢𝑢𝑜𝑜), aligning with the final PhD research objective.</p>
<p>The feasible and easily implemented methods developed in papers 3 and 4 (chapters 6 and 7) enable quantitative engagement with metropolitan and global policies in (i) selecting or refining sustainable future development sites; and (ii) maximising vegetation cooling potential of localised (re)developments, mitigating the requirement for costly and misguided planning, such as the urban forest plans currently being implemented across the Perth Metropolitan Region (PMR).</p>
<p>This thesis has produced the following novel academic research contributions:</p>
<p>• Provided and demonstrated a feasible and policy relevant methodological approach in accurately determining urban area for monitoring infill and density targets proposed by metropolitan development agencies overcoming current temporal inconsistencies and unrepresentative data metrics.</p>
<p>• Developed an approach which mitigates for the over and under estimation of urban area frequently reported using medium spatial resolution EO data. This was achieved by consideration of urban heterogeneity through establishing overestimation differing based upon the type of urban area through a novel spatially explicit approach which may reduce error propagation within future policy or environmental applications.</p>
<p>• Established an innovative approach for determining the association between land cover and temperature change, which overcomes simplification of current academic research that neglects land cover temperature dynamics through singular global metrics and frequent assumption of a singular homogenous urban areas.</p>
<p>• Demonstrated an original localised evidence-based data driven planning method through combining EO data and spatial modelling advancing current restrictions using coarse and temporally limited resolution data.</p>
<p>Combined, these novel academic contributions constitute an applied planning framework for accurately monitoring urban area, determining appropriate land rezoning locations in relation to surface temperature across metropolitan regions and optimising planning (re)developments for locally mitigating the UHI effect.</p>

<div id="methodological-transferability" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Methodological transferability</h2>
<p>The methodological approaches implemented within the four paper style chapters presented in this thesis can readily be reproduced across urbanising areas of the Earth’s surface. This section outlines the methodological transferability considering alternative study sites, data and personnel expertise for each stage of the applied methods.</p>
<p>The EO preprocessing (e.g. image merging and normalisation) and classification approach presented in chapter 4 required access to licensed remote sensing software including: ENvironment for Visualizing Images (ENVI), Arc Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and the Interactive Data Language (IDL). Due to the PMR covering two Landsat tiles a seamless image mosaic permitting less visible boundaries was produced with subsequent normalisation coded in IDL and classified in the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) through the IDL environment (MacLachlan et al., 2017a). Nevertheless, alternative study sites may be located within a single image or could implement a different mosaic methodology, with subsequent normalisation and classification in open source software such as Quantum Geographic Information Systems (QGIS), R statistical software, Python or the more commercially available Arc GIS (Biehl and Landgrebe, 2002). However, as specified in section 2.2, alternative classification procedures may produce different classified land cover accuracies.</p>
<p>For organisations such local governments that might lack remote sensing analysis expertise, freely available global pre-classified data are available including GlobeLand30 (classified Landsat data for 2000 and 2010) (Chen et al., 2015), the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) annual global land cover (300 m) time series (1992-2015) (European Space Agency, 2017) and yearly MODIS land cover products (500 m or 0.05°) (Friedl et al., 2002). However, global methodological classification approaches have the potential for misclassification of underrepresented, geographical or temporal specific attributes. For example, in Perth, high temperatures and low rainfall during the summer months can induce strong spectral similarities between bare earth and urban land cover types (Herold et al., 2002; Lu et al., 2011; Varshney and Rajesh, 2014). In terms of globally accuracy, statistics are often based upon a limited number of testing areas (e.g. Globeland30) that could be unrepresentative of other geographical locations (Chen et al., 2015). Additionally, future analysis (e.g. infill monitoring) would be reliant upon the continued data processing of external organisations. Whilst implementing pre-classified data of this sort would permit a valid approach, localised classifications such as that presented in chapter 4 mitigate study area specific issues, ensure future classification output and provided a localised accuracy assessment.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 required classified medium resolution land cover data (from chapter 4) alongside classified high resolution aerial data, achieved using Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) within eCognition. Alternative sources of high resolution data include Google Earth, local planning authorities or free satellite imagery request services (e.g. Digital Globe) that can be classified using manual digitisation or free software capable of OBIA such as SPRING or MultiSpec (Biehl and Landgrebe, 2002; Camara et al., 1996). However, the often limited temporal record (e.g. 15 years) of high resolution data in comparison to medium resolution data can restrict application to complete classified collections such as that in chapter 4. Chapter 5 established that, due the range of bias determined from comparison between classified Landsat and high resolution based upon differing urban forms (e.g. Central Business District and older suburban region), the presented correction models were not globally applicable. It is often unfeasible to procure and process high resolution imagery over complete metropolitan regions due to large data sizes (e.g. 8 Terabytes (TB)) for the PMR) and computationally intensive image segmentation routines. Consequently an approach to apply this methodological process across complete metropolitan regions would entail selection of subsets that are representative of localised land cover composition and spatial heterogeneity, such as the four areas presented in chapter 5. Divisions of the metropolitan region (e.g. census units or manually determined) would then be allocated to the most appropriate subset and assigned the associated correction factor. Methodologies of this sort are found within disaster risk fields (e.g. earthquake risk) when limited ground data must be aggregated to metropolitan regions (e.g. Bevington et al., 2012). Replication of this analysis could be undertaken in freely available software such as QGIS, R and Python.</p>
<p>The land cover – temperature association methodology presented in chapter 5 used 2003 and 2013 land cover obtained from chapter 4. Nevertheless, substitution of alternative aforementioned pre-classified data land cover would permit organisations lacking remote sensing classification expertise to replicate analysis. Freely globally distributed daily nighttime and daytime LST data from MODIS Terra (MOD11A1, collection 5 (Wan, 2006)) were used in assessing the association with land cover change. Landsat derived land cover was aggregated to MODIS resolution for both years and a change in land cover determined if (i) the change was greater than all other changes within a MODIS pixel, and (ii) the change to land cover dominated (&gt;50%) the 2013 MODIS pixel. This analysis was achieved in ArcGIS and R statistical software; the former was used to ascribe Landsat land cover to MODIS pixels, whilst the latter established land cover change and assigned temperature difference to qualifying pixels. Substitution of LST from sensors such as Landsat’s Thermal Infrared (TIR) sensor and MODIS Terra’s Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is possible, however land cover data must obtain a higher spatial resolution than LST (or sub-pixel land cover if the equivalent resolution) to permit the from-to change methodological approach (Cao et al., 2010). In this chapter’s methodology ArcGIS could easily be replaced with QGIS, Python or R.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 presented a data-driven approach in optimising vegetation placement for a proposed redevelopment. Holistic study area inputs to the model for this analysis were based upon aerial EO data including a building and ground Digital Surface Model (DSM), land cover, and a vegetation canopy Relative Elevation Model (REM). However, the required data layers can be determined from (re)development plans and associated planning applications such as those provided on the City of Fremantle’s planning portal using digitisation and raster creation tools within a GIS, if data are not already available in a spatial format. Other data sources including Google Earth, national Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) surface model composites (e.g. England and Australia) and freely distributed high resolution datasets such as the State of Indiana’s orthophotography, LiDAR and elevation dataset could be also be used in generating the required data layers (Environment Agency, 2016; Intergovernmental Committee On Surveying &amp; Mapping, 2008; The State of Indiana, 2017). Meteorological data from the Weather Underground Application Interface (API) enables access to over 250,000 weather stations in programming languages (e.g. R) which can extract the required parameters of air temperature, relative humidity and barometric pressure for temperature modelling (Lindberg et al., 2017). Downward shortwave radiation is often the restricting factor as it is infrequently monitored by meteorological stations. In chapter 7, this parameter was derived from the freely available ‘WATCH Forcing data ERA Interim’ providing the most extensive global temporal collection between 1979 (1901 for 20th century data) and 2012 at 3-hourly intervals (Uppala et al., 2005; Weedon et al., 2014). R statistical software was used to match hourly weather station data to 3-hourly downward shortwave measurements, with all datasets then input into the Urban Multi-scale Environmental Predictor (UMEP) model which is available as a free QGIS plugin. Replication of the methodological approach could easily be accomplished using QGIS to enable digitation and accessing freely available data sources.<br />
This section has provided an overview of the methodological transferability for each paper chapter presented in this thesis. Whilst the analyses undertaken often implemented proprietary software and data available through the University of Southampton and University of Western Australia (UWA), replication of all analysis either in individual papers or as holistic project is achievable using freely distrusted data and open source software (Table 8-1).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Global applicability</h2>
<p>In each paper style chapter the presented results are discussed in relation to relevant local (e.g. Perth and Peel @ 3.5 million) and broad international (e.g. SDGs) policies, aligning analytical findings with specified targets. This section identifies opportunities for methodological integration into international policy in ensuring successful achievement of the SDGs and UN Urban Agenda. Existing global targets and associated monitoring techniques in relation to urban expansion and the UHI effect are firstly described in order to frame idealistic methodological incorporation.</p>
<div id="existing-global-policies" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.3.1</span> Existing global policies</h3>
<p>The UN SDGs are composed of targets with measurable indicators enabling progress monitoring. For example, Goal 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable is composed of ten targets of which three consider urban area (Table 8-2) (Osborn et al., 2015).</p>
<p>Table 8-2. Targets and Indicators in monitoring Sustainable Development Goal 11: make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Adapted from United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (2018a).</p>
<p>Each indicator is accompanied by metadata documentation that provides a detailed monitoring methodological procedure. Nevertheless these indicators often fail to either incorporate EO data using local metropolitan derived estimates (e.g. 11.3 and 11.7) or implement global annual estimates (e.g. 11.6) with limitations of these approaches discussed in section 1.2 (Shaddick et al., 2018; United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, 2018b, 2018c; Van Donkelaar et al., 2016).</p>
<p>In contrast to the detailed SDG monitoring indicators, the New Urban Agenda provides only broad standards and principles for planning, construction, development, management and urban improvement (UN-Habitat III, 2017). In response to the lack of monitoring, the City Prosperity Index (CPI) was formulated by the UN-Habitat to collect urban data (e.g. urban indicators) to form strategic knowledge for evidence-based policies, city visions and long-term action plans in relation to the New Urban Agenda and SDGs (mostly goal 11) (UN-Habitat, 2016). However CPI outputs are chargeable per city, with the three combined outputs — city profiling, state of city report and city action plan — totalling $443,000 over a 3-year period. These implemented methodologies are withheld from publication, lacking peer-review validation from the scientific community and limiting methodological transferability and advancement (Lu et al., 2015).</p>
<p>SDG target 11.3 aims to promote sustainable development and human settlement but excludes measurement or monitoring of the UHI effect. Comparatively, the New Urban Agenda commits UN members to reduce the financial, environmental and public health costs of the UHI effect, yet lacks any monitoring approaches. This is despite heat related mortality rising to the third highest cause of global disaster mortality (Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disaster and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, 2016). ### Integration of analysis</p>
<p>The lack of urban and UHI methodological guidance often results in metropolitan development agencies producing urban estimates unrepresentative of actual land cover change (e.g. chapter 4) with UHI mitigation devolved to local government (Mayor of London, 2017; Western Australian Planning Commission, 2015a) or omitted from metropolitan consideration (City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality, 2016). Consequently, the absence of global methodological guidance in meeting targets of the New Urban Agenda and SGDs has produced inconsistent, varied and scientifically invalid urban monitoring and UHI informed mitigation plans, with the global state of data-informed governance recently described as underdeveloped, disparate and marginalised (McPherson, 2016; Michele Acuto, 2018). The presented methodologies in this thesis offer the potential to be integrated into the SDGs and New Urban Agenda documents. This is particularly relevant as the latter has no associated methodologies and it is essential to develop a framework for metropolitan areas to follow such as that of the SDGs to provide measurable indicators for targets. Measurement of urban areas currently included in the monitoring indicators of Table 8-2 are derived from a variety of sources and methodologies resulting in an inconsistency across target objectives and the overall SDG 11. In an idealistic scenario inclusion of the approach presented in chapter 4 into the methodology section of the metadata for SDG targets and a New Urban Agenda framework would enable replicable and comparable urban estimates alongside standardisation across targets and international policies.</p>
<p>Similarly, UHI targets should be included under SDG 11 and in relation to the New Urban Agenda for both determining future urban land (chapter 6) and localised remediation (chapter 7). Integration of EO data into SDG metadata methodology is already in existence for certain targets (e.g. Target 11.6). In this case a simplistic methodological overview is provided within the metadata alongside reference to the academic paper for further details. Consequently, in a similar theme metadata documents for targets requiring urban area estimates (e.g. 11.3 and 11.7) could be updated to reflect the published analyses presented within this thesis, alongside distribution of code in ensuring repeatability (Shaddick et al., 2018; United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, 2018d). Metropolitan development agencies responsible for guiding future development at the broad scale would then be able to incorporate land cover-temperature association into selection of future urban development sites (chapter 6), with proposed developments also locally optimised for UHI mitigation (chapter 7) (Table 8-1). Whilst planning requests are often dealt with by local authorities, endorsement of established frameworks by metropolitan agencies would ensure consistent, comparable and measurable UHI mitigation across local (re)developments. Simplistic and achievable alteration of planning proposal requirements such as inclusion of computerised building designs that often are produced to submit paper versions would streamline the analysis process. Incorporation of up-to-date methodological approaches in global policies would prevent consistent devolution of responsibility to metropolitan agencies and local councils whilst ensuring scientifically peer-reviewed data-informed governance in addressing the UN’s SDGs and the New Urban Agenda.</p>

<div id="critical-challenges" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.4</span> Critical challenges</h2>
<p>This thesis has identified current challenges within sustainable urban development and UHI academic EO studies, local and metropolitan government development guidance and international development goals. In summary, current academic research is inappropriate for policy integration as many UHI studies fail to quantify changes in land cover that are associated with temperature change, which are potentially environmentally, socially and economically detrimental (Kikon et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2014). Local governments either lack data-driven approaches or are restricted by temporal and spatial resolution constraints (City of Fremantle, 2017; USA Environmental Protection Agency, 2013), whilst metropolitan government urban monitoring for infill attainment is often based upon unrepresentative urban metrics (e.g. land zoned for development) with the potential to misinform development decisions (Western Australian Planning Commission, 2010b). These metropolitan urban estimates are also used within international development goal monitoring and, where methodologies are available, are often incomparable between countries due to differences in the definition of urban alongside available data (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, 2018b, 2018c, 2018d). Consequently in order to effectively ensure the future global sustainability of our cities it is essential for greater cohesion between these sectors and for deployment of globally recognised and accepted methodologies across both metropolitan agencies and local governments through the following key recommendations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Transform global sustainable urban policy documents such as the Sustainable Development Goals and New Urban Agenda to include consistent, open and scientifically valid methodologies in monitoring and planning future urban (re)development in relation to environmental factors including the Urban Heat Island effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Require (a) transparency of current metropolitan agencies in determining future land rezoning, (b) mandatory uptake of methodologies (proposed in recommendation 1), and (c) accountability for meeting global policy targets as opposed to current devolution to local governments</p></li>
<li><p>Encourage multi-institutional, applied and policy-integrated research in relation to specific targets of the Sustainable Development Goals and metropolitan development agencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Effectuate communication between local, metropolitan, national and international governments and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and New Urban Agenda in ensuring analytical suitability alongside effective uptake of methodologies proposed in recommendation 1.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.5</span> Limitations</h2>
<p>Each presented analysis chapter is associated with limiting factors, described within this section. Due to the limited availability of cloud free Landsat satellite imagery that coincided with peak green up (July in Western Australia) in order to maximise spectral contrast between spectrally similar surfaces (e.g. bare earth and urban) analysis was restricted to seven sequential snapshots of data as opposed to annual replication (Chen et al., 2014). Annual replication would enable consistent and up-to date comparison to infill and density targets, as specified by the Western Australian Planning Commission, permitting timely, targeted action to under achieving areas in ensuring attainment. Whilst chapter 5 provided a methodology for refinement of urban area estimations, due to the demanding processing for segmentation of high resolution imagery the analysis was limited to four subsets. Consequently, although this furthered current methodologies (e.g. Lu et al., 2011), application across a complete metropolitan region through an approach descried in section 8.2 could still retain errors in urban estimates due to heterogeneity of urban areas across metropolitan regions. Owing to the requirement of daily LST data, chapter 6 was limited to using coarse resolution MODIS data, although implemented rules attempted to extract valid land cover – temperature associations small, non-dominant land cover changes within identified pixels could have also influenced changes in temperature between the two time periods. Nevertheless the presented approach overcomes current temporal (e.g. Li et al., 2011; Tomlinson et al., 2012) and spatial restrictions (e.g. Kikon et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2017) of recent research, being more appropriate for applied policy outcomes. Whilst chapter 7 provided a localised methodology for optimising vegetation locations errors associated with digitisation of planning documentation (e.g. positional or attributable) could further propagate throughout the analysis (Heuvelink, 1999). Although the majority of analysis presented within this thesis only requires freely available remotely sensed data a form of planning redevelopment or proposal is essential for replication of chapter 7 which, based on local legislation could be publically unavailable. In terms global transferability the presented analysis has only considered a developed country and application of these methods to a developing country may present further challenges such as accurate land cover classification owing to the potential for greater diversity of urban characteristics (e.g. slums and informal residential areas). Even with these limitations considered, this body of work still provides substantial contributions to the academic literature.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.6</span> Future research</h2>
<div id="methodological-advancements" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.6.1</span> Methodological advancements</h3>
<p>In 2018 the UN estimated that 55% of the world’s population (7 .6 billion) reside in urban areas and by 2050 this predicted to increase to 68% of the world’s 9.8 billion inhabitants (United Nations, 2018). Future data resources will permit refinement of the presented analytical techniques in order to sustainably accommodate the forecast rise in urban dwellers. Free and commercial satellite data available at higher spatial resolution would enable further spatial refinement of analysis presented within chapters 4, 5 and 6. Specifically, in terms of land cover an increase in spatial resolution could provide more homogenous land cover per pixel potentially reducing classification spectral confusion and increasing overall accuracy. Similarly, in terms of LST higher resolution could potentially enable further refinement of specified requirements. For example, the change in land cover must be (i) the greater than all other changes (ii) the change must represent at least 50% of the pixel and (iii) dominate (&gt;50%) the pixel of the final year. Analysis of this sort would further reduce the possibility of erroneous land cover-temperature association, ensuring scientifically valid policy applications. Free surface reflectance data could include that from Sentinel 2 (20 m) with LST data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) (750 m) whilst commercial data from companies such as Planet can provide daily high resolution (1-5 m) imagery with global coverage. However daily high resolution LST products are unavailable, therefore although overall land cover accuracy would reduce the propagation of errors within chapter 6, outputs would remain restricted to the lowest resolution product.</p>
<p>Continuation of novel data combinations alongside further development of land cover classification algorithms will continually aim to improve upon classification outputs. In the case of the former a recently devised methodology automatically identified urban classification training areas from nighttime light data, subsequently used for classification of Landsat imagery in Google Earth Engine (Goldblatt et al., 2018). In the case of the latter the proposed Word ExtrAction for time SEries cLassification + MUltivariate Symbols and dErivatives (WEASEL+MUSE) observed an improved accuracy for rare and difficult land cover classes in comparison to the Random Forest (RF) classifier (Schäfer et al., 2018). Similarly, deep learning is currently the fastest growing trend in big data analysis, characterised by Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with more than two hidden layers found to be effective in image recognition (He et al., 2016), object detection (Girshick et al., 2015) and classification (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). Nevertheless the application of deep learning in remote sensing applications is relatively young, with rapid advancement expected in the coming years (Zhu et al., 2017). Implementation of these applications to medium resolution imagery and subsequent validation in comparison to high resolution data (e.g. chapter 5) is essential to establish potential improvements in current over or under estimation of urban area.</p>
<p>Future considerations pertinent to chapter 7 would include digital submissions of proposed (re)developments in order to mitigate errors associated with digitisation and analyst interpretation of proposed planning documentation. This method could easily be upscaled to complete local government or metropolitan areas in determining optimum locations for new vegetation, assuming available digital data such as that from Ordnance Survey’s MasterMap (the UK’s national mapping agency) OpenStreetMap, or local government spatial databases.</p>
</div>
<div id="technological-considerations" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.6.2</span> Technological considerations</h3>
<p>All analysis presented in this thesis were conducted on a standalone computer, often over extensive time periods. However, recent EO initiatives such as Google Earth Engine and Earth on Amazon’s Web Service (AWS) that store multi-petabyte catalogues of publically available datasets (e.g. Landsat and MODIS) significantly reduce local processing requirements permitting up to planetary scale analysis within minutes (Gorelick et al., 2017; Mathieu and Aubrecht, 2018). Due to the built in geoprocessing tools and script sharing functionalities these platforms have the potential to universalise endorsed methodologies for monitoring global targets such as the indicators of the SDGs, or approaches presented within this thesis. Consequently national, metropolitan and local governments would be able to replicate analysis with extremely limited script modification, such as appropriate selection of local training pixels for image classification (Gorelick et al., 2017). Simplifying complex methodologies in this manner would also overcome potential current barriers such as remote sensing expertise and proprietary software that could prevent uptake by local authorities. Nevertheless these global analytical platforms place reliance upon commercial companies that could reserve the right to withdraw, limit or charge for data processing capabilities, whilst also raising privacy concerns pertaining to unauthorised distribution of analytical results. Idealistically, legislative agreements between these companies, the UN and national governments could ensure the future availability of the analytical platforms in providing simplistic and efficient monitoring based upon complex methodological approaches.</p>
<p>The variety of future EO data sources, new data combinations, novel EO classification algorithms and online big data platforms will permit spatial and temporal processing refinement of methodological approaches and outputs presented within this thesis to inform and monitor local, national and global city development goals in relation to urban induced socio-environmental issues ensuring the future sustainability of our cities.</p>
